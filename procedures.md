# General Procedures

1. Brainstorming sessions will occur approximately monthly, time and day TBC, aim to have a regular day, but time can be adjusted to accomdate those around the world

2. Each session will be chaired by those who propose the topic with the support of the organisers if wanted. There can be multiple chairs, and the format is purposely flexible. Please aim for diversity in chairs/hosts

3. Proposing new topics can be done by lodging a new issue for the repository. This need not be detailed, and will allow others to step forward as potential co-chairs

4. Brainstorming sessions will occur via video conference call (likely zoom), but will NOT be recorded. This is to allow people to feel more comfortable with "asking stupid questions" and discussing work in progress. General notes may be taken for distribution afterwards at discression of the host(s).
