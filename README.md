# EvoEco-ECR-brainstorming

***This is the webpage for the EvoEco Early Career Researchers brainstroming group***

Our goals are to bring together ECRs in evolution, ecology, genomics, and related fields from across the world for monthly online brainstorming discussions about the big and small issues in our fields. These dicussions will hopefully replace some of the networking and interaction many of us are missing due to cancelled conferences and courses. And who knows, maybe some of these discussions will lead to new and interesting collaborations. Topics can range from broad and conceptual to specific and technical. We consider ECRs to be students and postdocs.

Topic proposals are welcome from anyone, so long as you are prepared to give a brief background and set the direction of the discussions at the start. Topics can be proposed by lodging an issue.

Please read the procedures and code of conduct pages before participating and before proposing discussion topics.


***How to join:***
48hrs before the scheduled session, the zoom meeting ID and password will be added under the topic issue to be discussed.
